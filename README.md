The main principle of Active Learning is that if a program can choose the data it learns from, then it is able to work with greater accuracy, while having less training. The use of Active Learning is recommended for Machine Learning problems where instances are numerous but the labels are few or labeling itself leads to great cost, both in time and resources.

This thesis titled ``Active Learning Strategies on Multi-Label Text Classification'' aims to compare existing query strategies both in single-label and multi-label text classification. Consequently, their performance was evaluated in relation to random sampling, so as to justify the extra complexity and computational cost associated with Active Learning methods.
